## Description

This password generator is designed to assist anyone in processing preference and practice unique exclusivity in their password needs. You can utilize anything from uppercase letter, to lowercase letters, to numerical values and spark it up with some special characters as well. 

This will be extremely useful in todays time as we need a password for dang near every account that is created!

This challenge showed me it takes more then a structured HTML and a pretty CSS stylesheet to make a good webpage. Javascript is the heart and soul of coding in my mind so far. This behavior I have learned in creating this password generator has shown me in breif the possibilities of Javascript, even though I know I have simply seen the tip of the iceberg, I am confident my talents will only improve from here.
